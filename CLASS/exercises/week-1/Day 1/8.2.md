For today (8/2/2022), there are a few things to do, ordered in terms of priority. 

1. If you have not completed your I-9 paperwork, make sure to do so ASAP. 
2. If you have not completed the initial Git exercise make sure to do that next. 
3. There is a new exercise on this repo, under the folder "unix_exercise". To get credit for this exercise, copy all of your commands used in the exercise, add it to the same repo as the first git exercise, and let me now through Teams (or email if Teams is not set up yet). I will check the repo and verify it from there. I will be checking this exercise tomorrow morning. 
4. Look over the [notes](https://github.com/Revature-Training-1302/notes/tree/main/week1) and [demos](https://github.com/Revature-Training-1302/demos/tree/main/week-1/HelloWorld) from today. You can clone the demos repo on your local computer to play around with the code and make sure you understand what's going on. 
5. Work on getting access to Teams. If you are having trouble with your email, please send an email to itsupport@revature.com.
