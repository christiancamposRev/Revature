Hello and welcome to the treasure hunt!

Your goal is to navigate through the house, find the treasure, and get rid of the trash! 

- use cd to change the current directory you're in
- use ls to view the contents of a directory
- use rm to delete a file (trash)
- use mv to move a file (treasure) into the chest outside of the house

- to check your answers, make sure you have 9 pieces of treasure in the chest directory
- also, use the find command to see if you missed any trash
- find . -name trash*
